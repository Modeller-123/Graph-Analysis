# Graph Analysis
This repository contains an application created for drawing and analysing simple undirected graphs.

## Drawing Graphs:
- Add vertices and edges to your graph by clicking and draging
- Automatically create n-star graphs and k-complete graphs of sizes up to 16
- Attempt to find the Chromatic number yourself using the colouring tool

## Analysing Graphs:
- Degree information (minimum, maximum, and average)
- Adjacency matrix
- Numbers of walks, general paths, and Hamiltonian path
- Katz centrality and page rank
- Diameter, girth, circumference, and distance
- Chromatic colouring
- Planar information

In the future I plan to optimise the GUI code further using additional functions to prevent unnecessary repetition.
